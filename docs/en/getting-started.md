## Step 3: Enable Focus Notification Bypass in HyperCeiler

> 💡 Super Island style notifications require HyperCeiler's "Focus Notification" bypass to display correctly. If your HyperCeiler version is too old, you may not find the corresponding options — please update to the latest version.

1. Open **HyperCeiler**, go to "System UI" or "Xiaomi Services Framework" settings
2. Find **"Remove Focus Notification Whitelist"** and **"Unlock Focus Notification Whitelist Verification"**

3. Enable and restart the scope

::: danger Built-in Bypass
The app includes a built-in whitelist bypass, but it doesn't support safe mode and may cause System UI to crash infinitely. Make sure you can recover your device before enabling.

## Step 4: Configure the Module

### App Adaptation
Open the **HyperIsland** app and enable the switches for the apps you need. It's not recommended to enable all.

::: tip Download Island Note
Download Island is disabled by default. Go to the app and enable **"Show System Apps"**, then check **"Download Manager"**.
:::

- **Notification Super Island**: Convert any notification to Focus Notification + Super Island display
- **Download**: Auto-detect download status and convert to Focus Notification + Super Island
- **AI Notification Super Island**: AI simplifies left and right sides of the Super Island

### AI Summary Configuration

- AI summary only supports **non-reasoning** models. Do not use reasoning models. For DeepSeek, use **deepseek-chat**
- URL must be fully filled in. For DeepSeek models, fill in `https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions` — **do not omit `/chat/completions`**
- If summary fails, it will automatically fall back to normal notifications. If not working, check your configuration
- If still failing, check if your **account balance** is sufficient
